策略：
速读，每一个章节最基本的读了，后面的难度的就先过。主要先通读此书，跳过的部分记录下来。以后有时间再回去啃。
权当做复习了。

目标:
了解底层基础，为Rust语言学习打下坚实的基础。


## Chapter 2

### 2.1 Information Storage
* word size decide max virtual memory a process can access
* big edian vs little edian
* linux 64 pointer size is 8 bytes. 
* a pointer = pointer addr + pointer type

boolean algebra:
* xor and its notation in c and math
* bitwise left shift and right shift, right shift has two types:
    * logical (fill left with zero)
    * arithmetic (fill left with arithmetic sign)

### 2.2 Integer Representations

2.24-2.3: skiped, too long.
2.32: skiped, due to previous skiped section(which this section depended on), it make things harder for me to understand it.
2.33-2.4: skiped
2.43-skiped


## Chapter 3: Machine-Level Representation of Programs

So why should we spend our time learning machine code? 
> By reading this code(assembly-code form), we can understand
the optimization capabilities of the compiler and analyze the underlying
inefficiencies in the code
