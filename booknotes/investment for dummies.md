## investment for dummies

本书当然是根据美国的情况写的，各种细节需要根据中国国情进行考量，但大的方向应该不会错。

##  chapter 03: Getting Your Financial House in Order before You Invest

* 投资越年轻越好，越早的越要承受更多的风险以期待更多的回报，因为想房产证券等在长远来看基本上是升值的，短期存在更大的风险，所以老的时候要规避风险，但是最好拿出一定比例的金钱去投资些风险相对高的产品，因为有可能多活好几十年 :)

* 养老保险
    * 一定要尽早开始，要不然要完成对应的目标每年的金钱存入的压力越大
    * 养老账户有tax return

* 子女上学:
    * 401plan，什么乱遭的投资结构要放在自己名下，不能放在孩子名下，要不可能会影响到孩子的救助金申请
    * 同样如果很快把按揭换完的话，学校也有可能因为你名下的房产影响到救助金申请

* 了解什么会收税，什么不会



* DCA (dollar cost averaging ): 就是定投，每个月固定投资些来分担风险
* VCA (value cost averaging): 定投的变种，比如这个月投资500，但是到月底损失了10%，那就是450，那下个月投资就是50+500=550， 就是价格高的时候就少投些，价格低的时候就是多投些。容易在股票价格上涨中回本，但是如果股价一直下跌会损失的很惨。

这两种方式： 书上说了，如果说你有很多钱，完全不必浪费自己的时间去搞定投，因为对应的波动对你来说根本没什么风险。

* 保险：（中国保险靠不靠谱 ！！），保险这东西，基础经济学中就已经阐述的很明白了，保险是风险转移工具，当你有足够多的钱去承担各种风险，就没有必要上保险了。当然，如果没有，比如你的亲人需要你来提供经济支持，就很有必要了。
    * 重要关键的资产一定要上保险
    * 关键的大病也要上保险



## chapter 04: The Workings of Stock and Bond Markets

* 公司集资的方式, stock & bond.各有利弊
* PE： 这没什么

Weighing whether markets are efficient：
说的就是，如果一个市场竞争充分的话，那每个投资者都会准确的根据信息反映出对应股票的经济价值，最终你看到的就是实际的价值的价格。那么你买到的和专业人士分析的股票是一样的效果。大家都没有买贵或者买便宜。
这就是efficient market，这个理论我觉得只是说你随便买就好了，但问题是股票的价值是反应在未来的，所以关键的一点还是你自己对于未来的想法。这个理论能解决的就是你买股票的时机（那就是任何时机节点都一样，你买不了吃亏）。但是我对于国内的直观感觉还是竞争不充分，而且有很多黑箱。

* 债券和股票基本上是竞争充分的市场，房地产则没那么

* Inflation and interest rates usually move in tandem.
    > The primary driver of interest rates is the rate of inflation. Interest rates were much higher in the 1980s because the United States had double-digit inflation. If the cost of living increases at the rate of 10 percent per year, why would you, as an investor, lend your money (which is what you do when you purchase a bond or CD) at 5 percent? Interest rates were so much higher in the early 1980s because you or I would never do such a thing.


Federal Reserve:(美联储)
* 美联储的构成：
    *  The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States. The Federal Reserve Board comprises the 12 presidents from the respective Federal Reserve district banks and the 7 Federal Reserve governors, including the chairman who conducts the Federal Open Market Committee meet- ings behind closed doors eight times a year.

* 美联储的职责：
    * 调节市场利率，供应货币总量，调节银行隔夜拆解利率
    > The Fed, from time to time and in different ways, attempts to influence the supply and demand for money and the cost of money. To this end, the Fed raises or lowers short-term interest rates, primarily by buying and selling U.S. Treasury bills on the open market. Through this trading activity, known as open market operations, the Fed is able to target the Federal funds rate — the rate at which banks borrow from one another overnight.


Many factors influence the course of stock prices. Never, ever make a trade
or investment based on what someone at the Federal Reserve says or what someone in the media or some market pundit reads into the Fed chairman’s comments. You need to make your investment plans based on your needs and goals, not what the Fed does or doesn’t do.


## chapter 05: Building Wealth with Stocks


 * Counting reasons to use indexes
    * First, they can quickly give you an idea of how particular types of stocks fare and perform in comparison with other types of stocks. (说的是不同类型的，比如代表整个美国交易市场价值的70的S&P500指数和代表中小企业的Russell 2000指数区别)

    * Indexes also allow you to compare or benchmark the performance of your stock market investments。（比对自己的收益，比如你投资的公司和对应的指数的基线差）



Stock-Buying Methods:

* mutual funds:
    * 优点：够分散，职业人员管理，低费用
    * 缺点：控制权不足

* ETF（不知道是什么）
* hedge funds（对冲基金）: 门槛比较高


Selecting your own stocks:
*  Before you invest in any individual stock, no matter how great a company you think it is, you need to understand the company’s line of busi- ness, strategies, competitors, financial statements, and price-earnings ratio versus the competition, among many other issues. Selecting and monitoring good companies take lots of research, time, and discipline.

*  So you need to understand the barriers to entry that a leading company has erected and how difficult or easy it is for competitors to join the fray.
* be wary of analysts' predictions, due to interets conficts, they may brand their client's company stock.


* Many brokerage firms happen to be in another business that creates enor- mous conflicts of interest in producing objective company reviews. These investment firms also solicit companies to help them sell new stock and bond issues. To gain this business, the brokerage firms need to demonstrate enthu- siasm and optimism for the company’s future prospects.

* day trading: 一天内交易，一次或者多次买入卖出。
    * 缺点：手续费，税费（美国一年内的收益算是短期收益，相应的收税也更高），需要大量时间关注
    * 更倾向于赌博



## chapter 06: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks


tools:
* value line: 这个产品是美国公司提供的一个股票数据report，按年收费的，费用不低

指标:

* cash flow: 公司的现金流，税法一般会允许对公司设备资产的减值做抵税，但是这种抵税会影响到公司实际的现金流估计

* Book value per share: 公司所有资产减去负债/股票数, 银行股需要注意这个值，因为银行股通常不会记录借出去的债务，这样如果债务没有被还清，那么这个值的真实性会受到影响
* Market share: 市场占有率
* P/E, (price-to-earnings ratio): 股票估值，价值/每股净盈利
* Capital structure: 资本结构
    * Short-term debt: Debt due within one year

        * Total interest coverage: (公司的利润除以公司所有债务)
            represents a similar comparison of profits to interest owed for all the debt that a company owes, not just long-term debt

* Current position: 公司所有能变现的资产除以今年要偿还的债务
* quick ratio: 所有能变现的资产(不包括库存)/今年要偿还的债务

            * Investments: stock & mutual fund
            * Property and equipment: 设备和资产的价格

                    * 简单来说就是一个公司的影响力，属于无形资产, （比如说可口可乐的配方和品牌知名度），Goodwill的估值一般是在一个公司收购另一个公司，在book value达成
                        协议的基础上的一个溢价

            * other assets

        * Liabilities:
            * Accounts payable: （账面待还）
                * When a company places orders to purchase things for its business, it sometimes has a lag between receiving a bill and paying it; the money owed is called accounts payable.


            * Accrued compensation： 养老账户，美国的是属于公司扣款，公司还（好像是）
            * Income taxes payable： 待交税
            * Dividends payable: 待分红

    * The Income Sheet:
        * Revenue: 收入来源

        * Expenses： 花费来源
            * It’s particularly useful to examine each category of expenses relative to (in other words, as a percentage of) the company’s revenue to see which ones grow or shrink.


* Exploring Other Useful Corporate Reports
    * 证券交易网站上能看到公司的其他信息

    * 10-Ks:
        > 10-Ks are expanded versions of the annual report. Most investment professionals read the 10-K rather than the annual report because the 10-K contains additional data and information, especially for a company’s various divisions and product lines.

        * 
    * 股东委托书(Proxy Statement):



*  Tips

    * Remember, though, that smart financial market participants are looking ahead, so if
    you run out to buy stock in a company that’s reporting higher profits, those higher profits are old news and likely have already been priced into the com- pany’s current market value.

    * About invest your own stock: Keep the amount that you dedicate to individual stock investments to a minimum — ideally, no more than 20 percent of your invested dollars. I encourage you to do such investing for the educational value and enjoyment that you derive from it, not because you smugly think you’re as skilled as the best professional money managers.


    * One final word of advice: Try to buy stock in good-size chunks, such as 100 shares. Otherwise, commissions gobble a large percentage of the small dollar amount that you invest. 



## chapter 07: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments


* bank
    *  certificate of deposit (CD)： 死期存款
    * CD vs bonds:
        *  The interest on CDs is fully taxable at the federal and state levels. Bonds, by contrast, are available (if you desire) in tax-free (federal and/or state) versions.

* fund（基金）:
    * Money market funds：货币基金
        * 优势：
            * 比存款利率高， 有些是免税的
            * a better replacement for bank, 存入金钱，取款用支票的形式
            * Money market funds are a good place to keep your emergency cash reserveof at least three to six months’ living expenses. They’re also a great place to keep money awaiting investment elsewhere in the near future. If you’re saving money for a home that you expect to purchase soon (in the next year or so), a money market fund can be a safe place to accumulate and grow the down pay- ment. You don’t want to risk placing such money in the stock market, because the market can plunge in a relatively short period of time.
        * 劣势：
            * 没有保险（不过正常情况下都非常安全，尤其是大的公司）
            * 
    * 

* Bond（债券）:
    * http://wiki.mbalib.com/wiki/Bond
    * 特点
        * 比CD和 Money market funds 的收益要高, 相对也安全些，尤其是大公司发行的。相对于股票来说，在坏的金融环境下，bond的收益普遍要好。
        * 可以在市场上进行买卖，liquidation 要好。
        * 是一种直接债务的体现
        * If interest rates fall, bond prices rise; if interest rates rise, bond prices fall。
            * 这部分原因是，假如利率涨了，对应的bond的利率也会涨，那么相对来说别人肯定会优先考虑利率高的bond

    * 维度:
        * Maturity, 成熟度:
            * 长期，中期，还是短期: 总的来说长期的yield通常会高些
        * 评级: AAA-C
        * issuer:
            * treasury，国债: 美国的国债是免税的
            * international bonds, 国际债券：国际债券的好处就是可以躲避本国的金融风险，但自身的风险也更高，收益有可能被汇率的波动offset掉
            * corporate bond，公司债
            * Convertible bonds，可转换债券：在特定条件下可以转换成对应公司的股份


    * 交易方式: 证券公司，基金公司间接管理
        * 不建议自己选择购买债券，分析难度，时间成本，佣金费用等等




tips:
* I don’t recommend buying individual junk bonds — consider investing in these only through a well-run junk-bond fund.

## chapter 08: Mastering Mutual Funds

About Mutual Funds:
* Such failures can’t happen with a mutual fund because the value of the fund’s shares fluctuates as the securities in the fund rise and fall in value. For every dollar of securities they hold for their customers, mutual funds have a dollar’s worth of securities. The worst that can happen with a fund is that if you want your money, you may get less money than you originally put into the fund due to a market value decline of the fund’s holdings — but you won’t lose all your original investment.

* All types of funds with higher operating expenses tend to produce lower rates of return on average. Conversely, funds with lower operating costs can more easily produce higher returns for you than a comparable type of fund with high costs. 

* Thus, a good fund should consistently deliver a favorable rate of return given the level of risk that it takes.
    * 历史收益比较高的fund，可能是由于以前的承受的风险比较高或者由于luck,所以买fund时候需要观察收益是否是合理或者合适就好。

* 注重基金公司的背景：
    * A great deal of emphasis is placed on who manages a specific mutual fund. Although the individual fund manager is important, a manager isn’t an island unto himself. The resources and capabilities of the parent company are equally, if not more, important. Managers come and go, but fund companies usually don’t.
* 频繁的交易会产生减少对应的回报
    * Mutual fund managers of actively managed portfolios, in their attempts to increase returns, buy and sell securities more frequently. However, this trading increases a fund’s taxable capital gains dis- tributions and reduces a fund’s after-tax return.


购买fund需要注意的点:
* 手续费，运营费


* Index fund：
    * index fund 费用低，所以收益要好，因为股票的平均收益在10%左右，1.2%的actively managed fund的手续费就看起来很高了

* Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)：

    * ETF 是属于基金，但是交易必须在brokerage（券商？）开户，像买股票一样，而且etf一般会track一些index，并会slightly偏离index的价值。
