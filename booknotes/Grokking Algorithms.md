## chapter 8: greedy algorithms

notes:

* what is greedy algorithm:
    *  In technical terms: at each step you pick the locally optimal solution, and in the end you’re le  with the globally optimal solution.
* >sometimes, perfect is the enemy of good. Sometimes all you need is an algorithm that solves the problem pretty well

## chapter 9: dynamic programming


notes:
* > Dynamic programming is powerful because it can solve subproblems and use those answers to solve the big problem. Dynamic programming only works when each subproblem is discrete—when it doesn’t depend on other subproblems.
