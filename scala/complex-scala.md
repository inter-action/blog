## Function vs Method

Function is instance extends FunctionX, while method is just a type, not a value or 
anything so it cant be assign to a variable.

convert a method to a function instance:

    m _

define a method:

    def <function_name>(s: String): Int = s.toInt + i

define a function:

    val strToInt = (s: String) => s.toInt

this links explain it very well
